## Getting started with Chart Controls

The best way to learn about Chart Controls is by looking at the [sample solution](sample/ChartSamples) where via interactive experience with the app you can learn about every chart type and every major feature. While modifying the control parameters and instantly seeing how that affects the look of the control, you can also get the generated C# or Visual Basic code to use in your apps.
