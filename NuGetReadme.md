# WinForms Data Visualization

This package is based on https://github.com/dotnet/winforms-datavisualization that contains source code of the `System.Windows.Forms.DataVisualization` namespace that provides charting for WinForms.

## What is done.
- .Net6+ support.
- Lots of performance improvements.
- Partial new WinForms designer support.  
  - Serialization / deserialization - all existing forms will work and you can drag chart control from toolbox on new forms. 
  - Editors porting status and more info are [here](https://github.com/kirsan31/winforms-datavisualization/tree/dev).
- Small bugs fixes.
- Nuget package.

## To Do.
- Adapt custom editors as match as possible.
- Probably full designer parity with .net framework version ðŸ¤”
