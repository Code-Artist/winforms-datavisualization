# WinForms Data Visualization

## What is done.
- .NET 6+ support.
- Lots of performance improvements.
- New WinForms designer support (not complete yet).  
  - Serialization / deserialization - all existing forms will work and you can drag chart control from toolbox on new forms. 
  - Editors porting status and more info are [here](https://github.com/kirsan31/winforms-datavisualization/tree/dev).
- Small bugs fixes.
- Nuget package.

## To Do.
- Full designer parity with .net framework version.
